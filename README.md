# Data-Science-Analyses

This repository includes some files consisting of work done in an introduction to Data Science labs.

All code uses python and python libraries such as Pandas, Seaborn, Numpy, etc.
The work was done using Google Colab.

Most of the work consists of using available datasets to extract and extrapolate data for insights and drive analytical decisions. With the use of graphs and charts, statistical reasoning is more clear which helped to drive to a coherent logical answer and/or solution for the problems.
